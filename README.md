# ARIMA_Bootstrap_KapselStat
The following code has been developed to perform predictions using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. Additionally, the code implements the moving block bootstrap method, which is useful for generating resampled datasets to enhance the robustness of the predictions. Users are also provided with the option to select an imputation method if needed, allowing for flexible handling of missing data.

This implementation is crafted in MATLAB and culminates in a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) designed for ARIMA forecasting. The GUI facilitates an intuitive experience, enabling users to easily input their time series data, select their desired parameters, and choose their preferred imputation method. The final output not only displays the forecast results but also visualizes the predicted values alongside the original data, helping users to better understand the model's performance.

The integration of the moving block bootstrap method enhances the reliability of the forecasts by addressing the potential issues of non-independence in the time series data. Overall, this code provides a comprehensive tool for time series analysis, catering to both novice and experienced users in the field.
